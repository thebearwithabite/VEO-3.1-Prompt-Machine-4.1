## 2026-04-15 - Added aria-labels to icon-only buttons
**Learning:** The UI extensively uses lucide-react icons within buttons without accessible text labels, presenting a systematic accessibility gap.
**Action:** Ensure all icon-only interactive elements receive descriptive `aria-label` attributes to support screen readers and keyboard navigation users.

## 2026-04-16 - Added loading state to async submit button
**Learning:** Users need immediate visual feedback when initiating long-running tasks. Disabling the button is good, but adding a spinner and updating the text confirms the action was received and the application is actively processing.
**Action:** Always include a loading spinner or active state text on primary action buttons that trigger async operations.
## 2024-04-21 - Added missing ARIA labels to icon-only interactive elements
**Learning:** Discovered icon-only buttons in the VideoResult component lacking `aria-label` and `title` attributes, which creates an inaccessible experience for screen reader users and those seeking tooltip context.
**Action:** Implemented `aria-label` and `title` properties on "Set active keyframe", "Apply Reference Guidance", and "Download image" buttons to improve screen reader accessibility and discoverability.
