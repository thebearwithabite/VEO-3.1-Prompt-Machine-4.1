## 2026-04-15 - Added aria-labels to icon-only buttons
**Learning:** The UI extensively uses lucide-react icons within buttons without accessible text labels, presenting a systematic accessibility gap.
**Action:** Ensure all icon-only interactive elements receive descriptive `aria-label` attributes to support screen readers and keyboard navigation users.

## 2026-04-16 - Added loading state to async submit button
**Learning:** Users need immediate visual feedback when initiating long-running tasks. Disabling the button is good, but adding a spinner and updating the text confirms the action was received and the application is actively processing.
**Action:** Always include a loading spinner or active state text on primary action buttons that trigger async operations.
## 2024-04-21 - Added missing ARIA labels to icon-only interactive elements
**Learning:** Discovered icon-only buttons in the VideoResult component lacking `aria-label` and `title` attributes, which creates an inaccessible experience for screen reader users and those seeking tooltip context.
**Action:** Implemented `aria-label` and `title` properties on "Set active keyframe", "Apply Reference Guidance", and "Download image" buttons to improve screen reader accessibility and discoverability.

## 2026-04-23 - [Add ARIA properties to image toggle buttons]
**Learning:** Image-only buttons used for toggling states (like selecting guidance frames) are completely opaque to screen readers without proper aria-labels and aria-pressed attributes. Relying on visual borders to indicate selection state is a severe accessibility anti-pattern.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` (using the image's name/context), `aria-pressed` (reflecting the boolean selected state), and `alt` text to the inner image for interactive image galleries/pickers.

## 2026-04-29 - [Replace hidden with sr-only for file inputs]
**Learning:** Using 'hidden' on custom file inputs removes them from the keyboard accessibility tree, meaning keyboard users cannot tab to them if they are wrapped in a label. On the other hand, programmatically triggered inputs using refs should use 'sr-only' and 'tabIndex={-1}' to keep them from generating confusing invisible tab stops.
**Action:** Use 'sr-only' and 'focus-within' styling for label-wrapped file inputs, and 'sr-only' with 'tabIndex={-1}' for file inputs triggered by external buttons via refs.
